Matlab simulation of 2D quadrotor systems

2DQuad - simulation of quadrotor system, implemented running control laws from "Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors", Mellinger and Kumar

2DQuadWithLoad - simulation of quadrotor system with load, implemented running control laws from "Trajectory Generation and Control of a Quadrotor with a Cable-Suspended Load", Sreenath, Michael, and Kumar

2DQuadWithLoadGui - simulation of quadrotor system with load, implemented as before, with GUI, allows for following of generated of optimal trajectories from the trajGen code package

trajGen - generation of piece-wise trajectories that minimize a kth derivative, implementation of techniques described in "Polynominal Trajectory Planning for Quadrotor Flight", Richter et al. and "Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors", Mellinger and Kumar
