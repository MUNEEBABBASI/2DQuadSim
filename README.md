Matlab simulation of 2D quadrotor systems

2DQuad - simulation of quadrotor system, implemented running control laws from "Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors", Mellinger and Kumar

2DQuadWithLoad - simulation of quadrotor system with load, implemented running control laws from "Trajectory Generation and Control of a Quadrotor with a Cable-Suspended Load", Sreenath, Michael, and Kumar

2DQuadWithLoadGui - simulation of quadrotor system with load, implemented as before, with GUI, trajectories can be generated between two specified points, as done in "Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors", Mellinger and Kumar
